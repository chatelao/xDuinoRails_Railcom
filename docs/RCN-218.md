# RCN-218: DCC-A â€“ Automatic Logon

## 1. General

### 1.1 Purpose of the Standard
This standard describes DCC-A, an automatic logon procedure for DCC. It significantly increases the user-friendliness of model railway controls. By applying this standard, the user is relieved of the burden of assigning addresses and functions. The goal is, for example, to have a vehicle available in the control panel with its name and all its properties immediately after being placed on the track.

### 1.2 Requirements
To comply with this standard, it is necessary to support all commands and data structures specified herein.

### 1.3 Identification and Detection of a DCC System
Control centers with active DCC-A generate the DCC signal with a special pulse width for the first zero after the preamble bits.

### 1.4 Message Security
Messages are secured with an 8-bit CRC in addition to the XOR byte.

### 1.5 Glossary, Definitions
- **Unique ID**: A unique identifier permanently programmed by the manufacturer.
- **ZID**: The identifier of the control center.
- **Session ID**: A variable that indicates the current operating phase.

---

## 2. General Procedure

The automatic logon is divided into the following main phases:
- **Singulation Phase**: Detection of existing decoders.
- **Announcement Phase**: Exchange of information between the control center and the decoder.
- **Registration**: The decoder is registered with the control center.

## 3. DCC Commands

### 3.1 Command Encoding
All commands for automatic logon begin with `1111-1110`.

### 3.2 LOGON_ENABLE
Logon request to the decoders.

### 3.3 SELECT
Selection of a decoder by the control center.

### 3.4 GET_DATA_*
Fetching data from the decoder.

### 3.5 SET_DATA_*
Transmitting data to the decoder.

### 3.6 LOGON_ASSIGN
Assignment of a vehicle address to the decoder.
