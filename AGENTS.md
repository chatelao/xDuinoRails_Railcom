# Agent Guidelines

## Documentation

- The English `README.md` and the German `README.de.md` must be kept in sync. Any changes to one should be reflected in the other.
- All C++ header (.h) and source (.cpp) files must be documented using Doxygen-style comments.
- Where applicable, comments should reference the relevant specification (e.g., RCN-217, RCN-218) and chapter.
